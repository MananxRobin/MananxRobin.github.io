# project1 Discription:-

You've been hired by a new space weather startup looking to disrupt the space weather reporting business. Your first project is to provide better data about the top 50 solar flares recorded so far than that shown by your competitor, [SpaceWeatherLive.com](https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/solar-activity/top-50-solar-flares) .  Links to an external site.

To do this, they've pointed you to [this messy HTML page](http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/radio/waves_type2.html) Links to an external site. from NASA [available here](http://www.hcbravo.org/IntroDataSci/misc/waves_type2.html) also Links to an external site. where you can get the extra data your startup is going to post in your new spiffy site. 

Of course, you don't have access to the raw data for either of these two tables, so as an enterprising data scientist you will scrape this information directly from each HTML page using all the great tools available to you in Python. By the way, you should read up a [Solar Flares,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare), Links to an external site. [coronal mass ejections](https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/help/what-is-a-coronal-mass-ejection-cme) Links to an external site., [the solar flare alphabet soup](http://spaceweather.com/glossary/flareclasses.html) Links to an external site., [the scary storms of Halloween 2003](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/3956/) Links to an external site., [intense solar flares](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/how-nasa-tracked-the-most-intense-solar-storm-in-decades/) Links to an external site.. 

# project2 Discription:-

We want to understand how efficient teams have been historically at spending money and getting wins in return. In the case of Moneyball, one would expect that Oakland was not much more efficient than other teams in their spending before 2000, were much more efficient (they made a movie about it after all) between 2000 and 2005, and by then other teams may have caught up. Your job in this project is to see how this is reflected in the data we have.
